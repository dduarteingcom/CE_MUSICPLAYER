            <Letra>Jeje
                Es una voz
                Hay un rayo de luz
                Que entró por mi ventana
                Y me ha devuelto las ganas
                Me quita el dolor
                Tu amor es uno de esos
                Que te cambian con un beso
                Y te pone a volar
                Mi pedazo de sol
                La niña de mis ojos
                Tiene una colección
                De corazones rotos
                Mi pedazo de sol
                La niña de mis ojos
                La que baila reggaetón
                Con tacones rojos y me pone a volar
                La que me hace llorar
                La que me hace sufrir
                Pero no paro de amar
                Porque me hizo sentir
                Que gané la lotería
                Antes de ella no sabía que alguien podía amarme así
                Ah ah ah ah ah
                Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
                Ah
                Ah ah ah ah ah
                Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
                Ah ah ah ah
                El día que te conocí, lo sentí, me deje llevar
                Me morí, reviví en el mismo bar
                Solo entraba para emborracharme
                Ey
                No esperaba enamorarme de ti
                Ni tú de mí
                Y pasó así
                Y así empezó nuestra historia
                No falla mi memoria
                Yo te dije "Baby
                ¿Qué haces tú por aquí?"
                Así empezó nuestra historia
                Y te lleve pa' Colombia
                Mi pedazo de sol
                La niña de mis ojos
                Tiene una colección

                Ah ah
                Me cuidas entre tu ventana (yeah, yeah)
                Y así empezó, ya ves (yeah, yeah)
                Mi pedazo de sol
                La niña de mis ojos

            <Letra>I want you by my side
                So that I never feel alone again
                They've always been so kind
                But now they've brought you away from here
                I hope they didn't get your mind
                Your heart is too strong anyway
                We need to fetch back the time
                They have stolen from us
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor
                You've never danced like this before
                We don't talk about it
                Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
                Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor
                You've never danced like this before
                We don't talk about it
                Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
                Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
                Shouldn't talk about it
                Coldest winter for me
                No sun is shining anymore
                The only thing I feel is pain
                Caused by absence of you
                Suspense is controlling my mind
                I cannot find the way out of here
                I want you by my side
                So that I never feel alone again
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor
                You've never danced like this before
                We don't talk about it
                Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
                Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor
                You've never danced like this before
                We don't talk about it
                Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
                Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
                Shouldn't talk about it
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor
                You've never danced like this before

            <Letra>Once upon a time not so long ago
                Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
                He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
                Gina works the diner all day working for her man
                She brings home her pay, for love, for love
                She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Tommy's got his six-string in hock
                Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
                So tough, it's tough
                Gina dreams of running away
                When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
                Baby, it's okay, someday
                We've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Livin' on a prayer
                Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
                You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Woah, we're half way there

            <Letra>Rising up, back on the street
                Did my time, took my chances
                Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
                Just a man and his will to survive
                So many times it happens too fast
                You change your passion for glory
                Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
                You must fight just to keep them alive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Face to face, out in the heat
                Hanging tough, staying hungry
                They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
                For the kill with the skill to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Rising up straight to the top
                Had the guts, got the glory
                Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
                Just a man and his will to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger

            <Letra>Look out for yourself
                I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
                For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
                I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
                When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
                Tell you, you're the greatest
                But once you turn, they hate us
                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Look out for yourself
                My enemy
                Look out for yourself
                But I'm ready
                Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
                And the laughter in the halls
                And the names that I've been called
                I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
                When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
                Tell you, you're the greatest
                But once you turn, they hate us (ha)
                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Look out for yourself
                My enemy (yeah)
                Look out for yourself
                Uh, look, okay
                I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
                I'm praying that somebody hope for me
                I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
                Posted, being a wreck of emotions
                Ready to go whenever, just let me know
                The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
                The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
                I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
                They wanna plot on my trot to the top
                I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
                I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock
                To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it
                And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'
                They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback
                I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
                Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)
                Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint, no way
                My enemy
                Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint
                Look out for yourself
