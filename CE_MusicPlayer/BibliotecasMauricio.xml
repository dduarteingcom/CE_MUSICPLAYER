            <Letra>Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
                I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
                Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)
                Wait until the reaper takes my life
                Never gonna get me out alive
                I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)
                My patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?
                Our patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?
                I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
                Where I'm losing all control
                'Cause there's magic in my bones
                I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
                Go ahead and throw your stones
                'Cause there's magic in my bones
                Playing with a stick of dynamite
                There was never gray in black and white
                There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)
                Feeling like a boulder hurtling
                Seeing all the vultures circling
                Burning in the flames I'm working in
                Turning in a bed that's darkening
                My patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?

                Where I'm losing all control
                'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)
                I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
                Go ahead and throw your stones
                'Cause there's magic in my bones
                'Cause there's magic in my bones
                Look in the mirror of my mind
                Turning the pages of my life
                Walking the path so many paced a million times
                Drown out the voices in the air
                Leaving the ones that never cared
                Picking the pieces up and building to the sky
                My patience is waning
                Is this entertaining?

                Go ahead and throw your stones
                'Cause there's magic in
                There goes my mind (I-I-I)
                Don't mind
                There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)
                There goes my mind (I-I-I)
                Don't mind (there it goes)
                There goes my mind
                'Cause there's magic in my bones

            <Letra>Rising up, back on the street
                Did my time, took my chances
                Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
                Just a man and his will to survive
                So many times it happens too fast
                You change your passion for glory
                Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
                You must fight just to keep them alive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Face to face, out in the heat
                Hanging tough, staying hungry
                They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
                For the kill with the skill to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Rising up straight to the top
                Had the guts, got the glory
                Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
                Just a man and his will to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger

            <Letra>Once upon a time not so long ago
                Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
                He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
                Gina works the diner all day working for her man
                She brings home her pay, for love, for love
                She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Tommy's got his six-string in hock
                Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
                So tough, it's tough
                Gina dreams of running away
                When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
                Baby, it's okay, someday
                We've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Livin' on a prayer
                Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
                You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer

            <Letra>Look out for yourself
                I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
                For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
                I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
                When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
                Tell you, you're the greatest
                But once you turn, they hate us
                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Look out for yourself
                My enemy
                Look out for yourself
                But I'm ready
                Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
                And the laughter in the halls
                And the names that I've been called
                I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
                When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
                Tell you, you're the greatest
                But once you turn, they hate us (ha)
                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Look out for yourself
                My enemy (yeah)
                Look out for yourself
                Uh, look, okay
                I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
                I'm praying that somebody hope for me
                I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
                Posted, being a wreck of emotions
                Ready to go whenever, just let me know
                The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
                The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
                I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
                They wanna plot on my trot to the top
                I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
                I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock
                To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it
                And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'
                They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback
                I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
                Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Oh, the misery
                Everybody wants to be my enemy
                Spare the sympathy
                Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)
                Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint, no way
                My enemy
                Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint
                Look out for yourself
