                Did my time, took my chances
                Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
                Just a man and his will to survive
                So many times it happens too fast
                You change your passion for glory
                Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
                You must fight just to keep them alive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Face to face, out in the heat
                Hanging tough, staying hungry
                They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
                For the kill with the skill to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor
                Stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Rising up straight to the top
                Had the guts, got the glory
                Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
                Just a man and his will to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger
                It's the thrill of the fight
                Rising up to the challenge of our rival

                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger

                I am sitting
                In the morning
                At the diner
                On the corner
                I am waiting
                At the counter
                For the man
                To pour the coffee
                And he fills it
                Only halfway
                And before
                I even argue
                He is looking
                Out the window
                At somebody
                Coming in
                Tata, tada, tata, tada

                "It is always
                Nice to see you"
                Says the man
                Behind the counter
                To the woman
                Who has come in
                She is shaking
                Her umbrella
                And I look
                The other way
                As they are kissing
                Their hello's
                And I'm pretending
                Not to see them
                And instead
                I pour the milk

                Is this just fantasy?
                Caught in a landside,
                No escape from reality
                Open your eyes,
                Look up to the skies and see,
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
                Because I'm easy come, easy go,
                Little high, little low,
                Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
                Me, to me
                Mamaaa,
                Just killed a man,
                Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
                Now he's dead
                Mamaaa, life had just begun,
                But now I've gone and thrown it all away
                Mama, oooh,
                Didn't mean to make you cry,
                If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
                Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
                Too late, my time has come,
                Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
                The time
                Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
                Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
                Mama, oooh
                I don't want to die,
                I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
                I see a little silhouetto of a man,
                Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
                Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
                I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
                He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
                Spare him his life from this monstrosity
                Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
                Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let me go) Will not let you go
                (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
                (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
                No, no, no, no, no, no, no
                Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
                Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
                For meee
                So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
                So you think you can love me and leave me to die
                Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
                Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
                Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
                Nothing really matters,
                Nothing really matters to me
                Any way the wind blows...

                Is this just fantasy?
                Caught in a landside,
                No escape from reality
                Open your eyes,
                Look up to the skies and see,
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
                Because I'm easy come, easy go,
                Little high, little low,
                Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
                Me, to me
                Mamaaa,
                Just killed a man,
                Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
                Now he's dead
                Mamaaa, life had just begun,
                But now I've gone and thrown it all away
                Mama, oooh,
                Didn't mean to make you cry,
                If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
                Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
                Too late, my time has come,
                Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
                The time
                Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
                Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
                Mama, oooh
                I don't want to die,
                I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
                I see a little silhouetto of a man,
                Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
                Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
                I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
                He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
                Spare him his life from this monstrosity
                Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
                Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let me go) Will not let you go
                (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
                (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
                No, no, no, no, no, no, no
                Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
                Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
                For meee
                So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
                So you think you can love me and leave me to die
                Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
                Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
                Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
                Nothing really matters,
                Nothing really matters to me
                Any way the wind blows...

                Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
                He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
                Gina works the diner all day working for her man
                She brings home her pay, for love, for love
                She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Tommy's got his six-string in hock
                Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
                So tough, it's tough
                Gina dreams of running away
                When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
                Baby, it's okay, someday
                We've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Livin' on a prayer
                Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
                You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
