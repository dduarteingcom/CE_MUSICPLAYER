                So that I never feel alone again
                They've always been so kind
                But now they've brought you away from here
                I hope they didn't get your mind
                Your heart is too strong anyway
                We need to fetch back the time
                They have stolen from us
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor
                You've never danced like this before
                We don't talk about it
                Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
                Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor

                Shouldn't talk about it
                Coldest winter for me
                No sun is shining anymore
                The only thing I feel is pain
                Caused by absence of you
                Suspense is controlling my mind
                I cannot find the way out of here
                I want you by my side
                So that I never feel alone again
                And I want you
                We can bring it on the floor
                You've never danced like this before

            Did my time, took my chances
            Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
            Just a man and his will to survive
            So many times it happens too fast
            You change your passion for glory
            Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
            You must fight just to keep them alive
            It's the eye of the tiger
            It's the thrill of the fight
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival
            And the last known survivor
            Stalks his prey in the night
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
            Face to face, out in the heat
            Hanging tough, staying hungry
            They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
            For the kill with the skill to survive

            Stalks his prey in the night
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
            Rising up straight to the top
            Had the guts, got the glory
            Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
            Just a man and his will to survive

                Is this just fantasy?
                Caught in a landside,

                Open your eyes,
                Look up to the skies and see,
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
                Because I'm easy come, easy go,
                Little high, little low,

                Me, to me

                Just killed a man,
                Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,

                If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
                Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
                Too late, my time has come,
                Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
                The time
                Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
                Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
                Mama, oooh
                I don't want to die,
                I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
                I see a little silhouetto of a man,

            I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
            For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
            I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
            When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
            Tell you, you're the greatest
            But once you turn, they hate us
            Oh, the misery

            Everybody wants to be my enemy

            My enemy
            Look out for yourself
            But I'm ready
            Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
            And the laughter in the halls
            And the names that I've been called
            I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
            When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

            I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
            I'm praying that somebody hope for me
            I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
            Posted, being a wreck of emotions
            Ready to go whenever, just let me know
            The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
            The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
            I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
            They wanna plot on my trot to the top
            I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
            I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock
            To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it
            And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'
            They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback
            I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
            Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Spare the sympathy
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Oh, the misery
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Spare the sympathy
            Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)

            Me quita el dolor
            Tu amor es uno de esos

            Me cuidas entre tu ventana (yeah, yeah)
            Y así empezó, ya ves (yeah, yeah)
            Mi pedazo de sol
            La niña de mis ojos
            Tiene una colección
            De corazones rotos
            Mi pedazo de sol
            La niña de mis ojos
            La que baila reggaetón
            Con tacones rojos y me pone a volar
            La que me hace llorar
            La que me hace sufrir
            Pero no paro de amar
            Porque me hizo sentir
            Que gané la lotería
            Antes de ella no sabía que alguien podía amarme así
            Ah ah ah ah ah
            Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
            Ah
            Ah ah ah ah ah
            Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
            Ah ah ah ah

                Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
                He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
                Gina works the diner all day working for her man
                She brings home her pay, for love, for love
                She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Tommy's got his six-string in hock
                Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
                So tough, it's tough
                Gina dreams of running away
                When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
                Baby, it's okay, someday
                We've got to hold on to what we've got
                It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                We'll give it a shot
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Livin' on a prayer
                Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
                You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Woah, we're half way there

                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Woah, we're half way there
                Woah, livin' on a prayer
                Take my hand, we'll make it I swear

                In the morning
                At the diner
                On the corner
                I am waiting
                At the counter
                For the man
                To pour the coffee
                And he fills it
                Only halfway
                And before
                I even argue
                He is looking
                Out the window
                At somebody
                Coming in

                Says the man
                Behind the counter
                To the woman
                Who has come in
                She is shaking
                Her umbrella
                And I look
                The other way
                As they are kissing
                Their hello's
                And I'm pretending

                Is this just fantasy?
                Caught in a landside,
                No escape from reality
                Open your eyes,
                Look up to the skies and see,
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
                Because I'm easy come, easy go,
                Little high, little low,
                Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
                Me, to me
                Mamaaa,
                Just killed a man,
                Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
                Now he's dead
                Mamaaa, life had just begun,
                But now I've gone and thrown it all away
                Mama, oooh,
                Didn't mean to make you cry,
                If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
                Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
                Too late, my time has come,
                Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
                The time
                Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
                Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
                Mama, oooh
                I don't want to die,
                I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
                I see a little silhouetto of a man,
                Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
                Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
                I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
                He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
                Spare him his life from this monstrosity
                Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
                Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let me go) Will not let you go
                (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
                (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
                No, no, no, no, no, no, no
                Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
                Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
                For meee
                So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
                So you think you can love me and leave me to die
                Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
                Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
                Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
                Nothing really matters,
                Nothing really matters to me
                Any way the wind blows...
